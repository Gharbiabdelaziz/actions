Certainly! The `if` statement in the provided GitHub Actions workflow is a conditional expression that determines whether the subsequent jobs and steps should be executed based on a specific condition. In this case, the condition is:

```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

This condition checks if the Git reference of the triggered event is equal to 'refs/heads/main'. In GitHub Actions, the `github.ref` context variable contains the Git reference for the event. The expression evaluates to true if the branch being pushed to is the 'main' branch.

If the condition is true, the subsequent steps defined under the `deploy_job` job will be executed. Otherwise, if the condition is false, the job and its steps will be skipped, and the workflow will move on to the next event or job.

In summary, this `if` statement ensures that the deployment job (`deploy_job`) runs only when changes are pushed to the 'main' branch, preventing unnecessary deployments for changes in other branches.

```yaml
